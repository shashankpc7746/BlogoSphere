  <h1>The Search for Exoplanets: Worlds Beyond Our Solar System</h1>
  <div class="poster">
    <div id="img_poster">
      <h2>Introduction:</h2>
      <p>
        In the vast cosmos, our solar system is a tiny speck. Yet, as our cosmic
        understanding grows, so does our awareness of other worlds beyond. The
        search for exoplanets, planets orbiting stars outside our system, is a
        thrilling frontier in astronomy. Each discovery unveils diverse
        planetary systems, from gas giants to rocky orbs, offering insights into
        planetary formation and the potential for life elsewhere. This quest
        inspires awe and raises profound questions about our place in the
        universe. With advancing technology, we edge closer to uncovering
        habitable worlds and the possibility of encountering extraterrestrial
        life.

  <h2>Transit Method:</h2>
  <p>
    Exoplanets come in all shapes and sizes, from giant gas giants larger than
    Jupiter to small, rocky worlds similar to Earth. Some orbit close to their
    parent stars, where temperatures are scorching hot, while others are
    situated in the frigid outskirts of their solar systems. One of the primary
    methods astronomers use to detect exoplanets is called the transit method.
    This technique involves measuring the slight dimming of a star's light as an
    exoplanet passes in front of it, blocking a small fraction of its light. By
    carefully observing these periodic dips in brightness, astronomers can infer
    the presence of one or more exoplanets orbiting the star.
  </p>

  <h2>Radial Velocity Method:</h2>
  <p>
    Another common method used to detect exoplanets is the radial velocity
    method. This technique relies on measuring the tiny wobbles in a star's
    motion caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting exoplanet. By
    carefully monitoring these subtle shifts in a star's velocity, astronomers
    can infer the presence of one or more exoplanets orbiting the star.
  </p>

  <h2>Potentially Habitable Worlds:</h2>
  <p>
    One of the most exciting recent developments in the field of exoplanet
    research is the discovery of potentially habitable worlds. These are
    exoplanets that orbit within the "habitable zone" of their parent stars,
    where conditions may be right for liquid water to exist on their surfaces.
    Perhaps the most famous example of a potentially habitable exoplanet is
    Proxima Centauri b, which orbits the star closest to our own Sun, Proxima
    Centauri, located just over four light-years away from Earth. Proxima
    Centauri b is a rocky planet with a mass similar to that of Earth, and it
    orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star, where temperatures are
    neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to exist.

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>
    The search for exoplanets is still in its infancy, but already it has
    revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos. With each new discovery, we
    come one step closer to answering one of humanity's oldest and most profound
    questions: are we alone in the universe? In the coming years, as our
    technology continues to improve, astronomers will no doubt discover many
    more exoplanets, perhaps even worlds that are similar to our own. And who
    knows what other surprises may be waiting for us out there, in the vast,
    unexplored depths of space.
