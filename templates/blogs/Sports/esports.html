    While competitive gaming has been around for decades, the modern esports
    industry began to take shape in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the rise
    of games like "StarCraft," "Counter-Strike," and "Quake." These early
    tournaments were small-scale events, often organized by passionate fans and
    amateur gaming leagues. However, as the popularity of online gaming grew, so
    too did the demand for professional esports competitions.

    "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive" became household names, attracting millions
